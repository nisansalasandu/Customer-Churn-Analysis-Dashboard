## 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Insights Dashboard

### 📘 **Project Description**

This Power BI project analyzes telecom customer data to uncover insights into **customer churn**, **call usage behavior**, and **service patterns**.
The interactive dashboard provides a clear view of how different factors—such as call charges, service usage, and plan types—affect customer retention and churn.


### 🎯 **Objectives**

* Import and clean the dataset in Power BI
* Create meaningful KPIs using DAX
* Build interactive visualizations (bar charts, columcharts, donut charts, maps, scatter plots, line charts)
* Enable dynamic filters and slicers for exploration
* Publish and share the Power BI dashboard


### 🧰 **Tools and Technologies**

* **Power BI** – for data visualization and dashboard design
* **DAX** – for custom calculated measures
* **Telecom Churn Dataset** – source data for analysis
